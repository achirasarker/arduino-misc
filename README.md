A collection of different mini projects built using Arduino. 

myKeypad - Reads values from a keypad using the Keypad.h library, controls a servo motor using a potentiometer. <br> <br>
waterSensor - Turns a buzzer on/off after reading values from a water sensor. <br> <br>
lcd - Writes a message to a 16x2 LCD. <br> <br>
smartDoorLock - If the user types the correct password onto the keypad, the led will turn blue and solenoid door lock  will open. Otherwise, the led will turn red and the lock will close. <br> <br>
securitySystem - When a fire, gas or water leakage is sensed, the buzzer is activated and the user is shown an alert message on an LCD. <br> <br>
irrigationSystem - When the soil moisture sensor detects dry soil, the DC water pump is activated through the relay module, which waters the soil. <br> <br>
weatherStation - Collects weather data using the DHT11 sensor, then sends it to the ThingSpeak platform using an ESP8266 WiFi module. <br> <br>
